# Three Sum Problem in Java

## Overview

This project solves the **Three Sum Problem**: given an array of integers, the task is to find all unique triplets in the array that sum up to zero. The solution should return these triplets without any duplicates.

The algorithm uses sorting and the two-pointer technique to efficiently find the triplets in **O(n²)** time complexity.

## Problem Statement

Given an array `nums`, find all unique triplets `[nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]]` such that:

- `i ≠ j ≠ k`
- `nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0`
