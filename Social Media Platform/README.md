To get a proper real-time preview of your HTML code in Visual Studio Code (VS Code), you can use the following steps and extensions:

### 1. Install **Live Server** Extension
This extension provides a quick way to view your HTML changes live in a browser. Follow these steps:
- Open VS Code.
- Click on the Extensions icon on the sidebar or press `Ctrl+Shift+X`.
- Search for **"Live Server"** by Ritwick Dey.
- Click **Install**.

### 2. Run the Live Server
Once installed:
- Right-click on your `index.html` file in VS Code.
- Select **"Open with Live Server"**.
This will launch your HTML file in a browser window, and any changes you make in the HTML/CSS/JavaScript will automatically be updated.

### 3. Structure Your Files
Make sure your project directory is structured correctly:
- `index.html` should be in the root directory.
- `styles.css` should be in a subdirectory called `styles` (as referenced in your HTML) or adjust the link tag if placed elsewhere.
