# Graph Depth-First Search (DFS) Implementation

## Overview

This project implements a simple **Depth-First Search (DFS)** algorithm to traverse a graph starting from a given vertex. The graph is represented as an adjacency list using Java's built-in data structures.

DFS is a recursive algorithm that visits all vertices in a graph by starting at the given node and exploring as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

## Features

- **Graph Representation**: The graph is represented using an adjacency list.
- **Graph Traversal**: The DFS algorithm traverses the graph starting from a specified vertex and visits each connected vertex exactly once.
- **Edge Addition**: The graph is undirected, meaning if there is an edge between two vertices, you can traverse in both directions.
