## Problem List
1. **Q1: Reverse a Stack**  
   _Description_: You are given a stack of integers. Your task is to reverse the order of the elements in the stack using only stack operations (push and pop) without using any additional data structures.  
   **Example**:  
   Input: stack = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
   Output: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
2. **Q2: Three Sum Problem**  
   _Description_: Given an array of integers, find all unique triplets in the array which give the sum of zero. The solution should return the list of unique triplets.  
   **Example**:  
   Input: `nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4]`  
   Output: `[[-1, 0, 1], [-1, -1, 2]]`
3. **Q3: Depth-First Search (DFS)**  
   _Description_: Implement Depth-First Search (DFS) to traverse a graph starting from a given vertex. The graph is represented by an adjacency list.
4. **Q4: Create a Simple Website**  
   _Description_: Create a simple website with the following features:
   - A welcoming message and a brief description.
   - Navigation links to the homepage, about page, contact page, and blog page.
